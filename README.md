This project aims to develop a custom software application for Grazioso Salvare, an international rescue-animal training company. The goal of this project is to build a full-stack application that processes data from local animal shelters near the Austin, Texas area. The software will allow users to view and filter dogs based on animal type which is more suitable for search-and-rescue training. The users will filter the dogs based on features including age and breed. By implementing CRUD functionality in the application, users can manage shelter data effectively. The application will consist of a database backend and a user-friendly web-based dashboard to allow effective navigation.

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I think that the CRUD Pyhton module is extremely versatile. I order to effectively adapt the module to PROJECT 2 I made sure that there was vast comments indicating what every method was for. If I needed to revisit the CRUD Python Module it was easily readable .



How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I think this course was more centered on the client's request. I think other courses gives you maybe a few constarints, but really allow for some creative freedom. This project for Grazioso Salvare, had a defined set of needs and wants, and there was no room for creative liberty. 



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist facilitate everyday programs. I think the Salvare project illustrates this well. The company needed a application that would allow users to readily access data based on their needs. This is where computer scientist come in and facilitate the task by creating a program which allows them to look for exactly what they are looking for and returns only the desired results.
